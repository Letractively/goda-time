[GWT](http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/) port of [Joda-Time](http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/)

Goda-Time provides a first class date and time API for GWT based on the Joda-Time paradigm (which differs from the java.util.Calendar paradigm).  At present GWT [lacks](http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/issues/detail?id=603) emulation of java.util.Calendar and it is likely to remain that way.

Goda-Time still needs help with cleanup and unit tests. Goda-Time needs volunteers.  Send a message to the [group](http://groups.google.com/group/goda-time) to indicate your interest.
